# Forecasting-Number-Generation

### Phase 1 - Linear Progression

Create a random number generator that will count up incrementally by 1.

The LinearRandomGenerator can count up by 1

Create a forecaster that can catch this pattern

The LinearForecaster can catch a linear generator that always increases by 1

### Phase 2 - Simple Pattern

Create a random number generator that will add more complexity to the output.

The LinearRandomGenerator can count up by 1, or and constant number

Create a forecaster that can catch this patter

The LinearForecaster can catch a linear generator that always increases by 1, by either a constant or variable length

### Phase 3 - Complex Random Number Generator

Create our best random number generator.  This shouldn't be guessable.
